		<h1 id="important-events"><i>Important Events</i></h1>
			<p>Spanish Armada - This battle was fought in the English Channel in 1588, and as a result of the English victory, Spain entered a long period of political, economic, and social decline.</p>
			<p>War of the Spanish Succession - The Treaty of Utrecht which ended this war prevented the unification of the French and Spanish thrones under a single monarch.</p>
			<p>Glorious Revolution - As a result of this conflict in England, the political philosophy of John Locke was embraced, and a constitutional monarchy was confirmed by William and Mary.</p>
			<p>the Fronde - This revolt in France, resulted in Louis XIV's distrust of the nobility, and over the course of his rule he gradually reduced noble power in France.</p>
			<p>the Continental System - This was Napoleon's failed attempt to isolate the English economy from trade with French controlled Europe. It was broken by the Russians causing Napoleon to invade in 1812.</p>
			<p>St. Bartholomew's Day - This event exemplified the religious violence in France in the wake of the Protestant Reformation.</p>
			<p>Pugachev's Revolt - This revolt in Russia led Catherine the Great to abandon the enlightened principles she hoped to institute in her country.</p>
			<p>the Great Schism - This crisis in the Roman Catholic Church led to first two and then three sitting Popes. It damaged papal prestige.</p>
			<p>Council of Trent - The Catholic church's response to the issues raised by the Protestant reformation were formulated at this meeting held in 1540.</p>
			<p>Peace of Augsburg - In 1555, this treaty ended the religious violence in the Holy Roman Empire and established the doctrine of cuius regio, eius religio (whose region, his religion).</p>
			<p>the Stuart Restoration - After the death of Cromwell, this event reestablished royal power in England.</p>
			<p>Treaty of Westphalia - This treaty ended the Thirty Years' War and resulted in the recognition of Calvinism. It also confirmed the independence of the United Provinces of the Netherlands and the Swiss Confederation.</p>
			<p>Civill Constitution of the Clergy - During the moderate phase of the French Revolution, this governmental arrangement with the French Church made clergymen little more than employees of the state.</p>
			<p>Pragmatic Sanction - This was issued by Charles VI of Austria and declared that Habsburg lands were to remain intact regardless of who inherited the throne.</p>
			<p>Edict of Nantes - This was issued by France's Henry IV (Henry of Navarre) in order to reestablish order after the War of the Three Henrys. It granted limited toleration to the Huguenot minority in France.</p>
			<p>Reign of Terror - Robespierre is most closely associated with this period of the French Revolution-a period during which the guillotine was used to execute royalists, moderates, and other enemies of the regime.</p>
			<p>German Peasants' Revolt - As a result of this violent event, Martin Luther wrote Against the Murdering Thieving Hordes of Peasants.</p>
			<p>Enclosure - This event/trend in England resulted in the peasants' loss of access to common land, and as a result, many peasants became landless cottagers.</p>
			<p>Babylonian Captivity - This is the name given to the period of time during which the papacy took up residence in Avignon.</p>
			<p>English Civil War - This English conflict was fought between the forces of the king and the forces of Parliament. As a result of the conflict, Charles I was executed and Oliver Cromwell established a protectorate over England</p>
			<p>Price Revolution - This event/trend occurred during the latter stage of the European Age of Discovery and was the result of high inflation brought on by population increase and an influx of silver from the &quot;new world.&quot;</p>
			<p>carnival - This annual celebration preceded Lent, and during the early modern period it was characterized by revelry and excess.</p>
			<p>Tennis Court Oath - This event of the moderate phase of the French Revolution resulted in the creation of a national assembly that included members of all three estates of the French realm.</p>
			<p>the Dutch Revolt - Although this conflict was, on the surface, a war of religion, it had both political and economic overtones. As a result of the conflict, Spain lost control of a wealthy region and Amsterdam became Europe's center of banking and commerce for a brief period of time.</p>
			<p>the Black Death - This arrived in Europe in 1342 at the port city of Messina, and by the time it ran its course, Europe lost between one-third and one-half of its population.</p>
